# VCPE-rna P2.3-B Result Report (2026-09-02)

> **⚠️ Numbers in this report are withdrawn; the architectural conclusion is not.** The finding that a per-gene direct head restores conditioning stands. But `pearson_dev = 0.3079` was a maximum over epochs on the test split (E3), the ablation varied two factors at once whenever the RNA axis was enabled (E7), and unmeasured panel columns entered the metric unmasked (E6). See [../ERRATA.md](../ERRATA.md).

## One-line conclusion

**Conditioning revived; G2''' (pearson_dev ≥ 0.30) passed** — a GEARS-style per-gene residual head
achieved in 80 seconds of training what three generations of additive-pert-token-into-the-SE-backbone
(P2/P2.1/P2.2, 23 epochs combined) could not: making perturbation identity genuinely drive the output.

## Final numbers (60 epochs, test = 276 perturbations, deterministic protocol)

| Metric | P2.3-B best | Reference | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ablation_r (real vs zeroPert)** | **0.277 plateau** (stable <0.5 from ep13) | P2/P2.1/P2.2 all 1.000 | ✅ **conditioning revived** |
| **pearson_dev (G2''')** | **0.3079** (ep48) | gate ≥ 0.30 | ✅ pass (barely) |
| top50_dev | 0.3245 | — | ✅ |
| mse_DE | 0.0188 | ctrl baseline 0.0377 (50% better) | ✅ |
| pearson_delta | 0.6505 | P2-line 0.594 (different protocol, directional reference) | ✅ |
| top50_deg_overlap | 0.4629 | P2-line 0.418 (same) | ✅ |
| Training cost | **~80 s** (1.3 s/epoch × 60) | P2.2 was 16 h | ✅ ×440 iteration speed |

Deliverable: `p3_out/ckpt_p3_best_dev.pt` (ep48, best pearson_dev; includes common_fc and hvg_rows).

## Architecture (why it worked this time)

```
pred_dev_i = MLP([ g_i, p, g_i⊙p, rna_p, ctrl_expr_i, is_neighbor_i, is_target_i, ds ])
```

- Each gene's prediction takes (own embedding × perturbation embedding) **directly** as input —
  perturbation information reaches every gene without passing through the 600 M SE backbone's
  residual stream (the P2-line failure path); structurally there is nothing to drown in
- Frozen ESM2 table as buffer (5.7 M params, all trainable); STRING-neighbor and is_target indicators
  give an explicit "which genes should this perturbation affect" prior (the same mechanism as GEARS)
- The protocol fully inherits P2.1: residual target = full fc − train-only common core (no leakage)

## The P2 → P2.1 → P2.2 → P2.3-B evidence chain (archived)

| Version | Target | Conditioning channel | epochs | r(real, zeroPert) | pearson_dev |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P2 | full fc | SE backbone + additive pert token | 20 | 1.000 (dead) | — (inflated by shared response) |
| P2.1 | residual fc | same | 2 | 1.000 (dead) | showed 0.92 (dev-metric bug, invalid) |
| P2.2 | residual fc | same + STRING network axis | 1 | 1.000 (dead) | showed 0.93 (same bug, invalid) |
| **P2.3-B** | residual fc | **per-gene direct head** | 60 | **0.277** | **0.3079 ✅** |

Conclusion: the objective and the information sources were both correct — the failure was in the
**information pathway**. An additive token flowing into a large backbone's residual stream gets
structurally drowned; a per-gene direct head is the right architecture in the data-limited regime.

## Honest caveats

1. **pearson_dev 0.31 passes by a hair**: among 1,843 perturbations, the learnable gene-specific
   signal is limited — the current ceiling is more likely **data volume** than the model. The path up
   is more perturbation data (LINCS L1000 perturbational subset, more Perturb-seq datasets), not a
   bigger model
2. The ablation zeroes the ESM2 vector; the neighbor/self indicator features still carry perturbation
   identity — r = 0.28 is the joint effect of three axes; per-axis ablation is future work
3. `mse_dev ≡ mse_DE` (float-tail difference) is a mathematical identity in this protocol
   (full = common + dev adds back exactly), not a bug
4. Dataset-level residual commonality (K562/RPE1-specific responses) may still be partially exploited
   via the ds one-hot — a ds-shuffle ablation would isolate this if needed

## Next steps

1. **Cache export v2**: batch inference over 19,790 genes with the P2.3-B head (minutes, no SE
   needed), regenerate the platform cache → spot-check fc amplitude and discrimination → platform
   integration (P3 proper)
2. **Data-expansion track** (the fundamental fix for the pearson_dev ceiling): evaluate LINCS
   siRNA/ASO subset ingestion
3. Resume L2-1 pretraining (RNA-encoder expansion; the sequence axis now has a clean measurable
   landing spot: pearson_dev)
